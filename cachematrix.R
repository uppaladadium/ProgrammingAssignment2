### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
## repeatedly. The following are a pair of functions that
## cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inverse <- NULL
    
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inverse <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() x
    
    setinverse <- function(inv) inverse <<- inv
    getinverse <- function() inverse
    
    list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special
## "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
## already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
## `cacheSolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inverse <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inverse)) {
        message("returning cached data")
        return(inverse)
    }
    
    data <- x$get()
    inverse <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(inverse)
}
